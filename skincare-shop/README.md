This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## The task

It's quite simple. You just need to take a look at the app- the easiest way would be to pull it down, install the dependencies and get it running, and then open the repo in an editor.
You and the interviewing developer will spend up to 30 minutes looking at it together, and all you need to do is talk through what you're seeing.
A few areas you can focus on include:

- What the app is doing
- Any issues you might see
- Any features you might want to develop next
- Styling
- Your opinions on choices that have already been made

You're free to talk about anything you want; the interviewer will prompt you if there's more to explore or help if you're not sure what to look at.
There's no need to make any modifications to the code, of course you're welcome to if you really fancy it.
